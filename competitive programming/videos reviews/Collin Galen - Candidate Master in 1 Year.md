## Always
- it's ok to make mistakes, try to learn from every problem

## Before practice
- do topic based learning if necessary:
	- USACO.guide

## Doing practice
- do metacognition - writing your thought progress during solving a problem (6:00)
- if something goes over your head, run after it (c) Galen's wisdom #2 (4:50)

## After practice
- keep track of every problem you do and whole thought process (6:44)
